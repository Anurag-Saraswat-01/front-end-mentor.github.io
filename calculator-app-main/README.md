## Overview

This is my first try and building a project using VueJs. Coming from a React background, it took me a while to get going but now I can say that Vue is definitely very fun Framework and I would probably try it out more in the future over React. This was also my first time building a theme toggle, so that was a new challenge I undertook. The calculator itself uses Postfix notation and Stack implementation to calculate the value of the expression.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser
